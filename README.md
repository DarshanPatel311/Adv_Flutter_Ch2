<h3 align="center">ðŸ“± 2.2 Cupertino Widgets (Plarform Conevrter using provider) ðŸ“±</h3>

#

* In Flutter, Cupertino widgets refer to a set of widgets designed to emulate the look and feel of iOS applications. These widgets follow the design language established by Apple for iOS   apps, providing a consistent and familiar user experience for iOS users.

* Cupertino widgets offer UI components such as buttons, navigation bars, sliders, switches, and more, all styled according to iOS design principles. Developers can use these widgets to   build cross-platform Flutter applications that closely resemble native iOS apps.

Features

* Adaptive Widgets: The app leverages adaptive widgets to dynamically adjust the UI components based on the selected platform, ensuring a consistent and native user experience.
* Platform Switcher: Users can effortlessly switch between Material Design and Cupertino Design UI platforms using a simple toggle switch.
* Provider Package Integration: State management for the UI platform switching logic is handled efficiently with the Provider package, offering a clean and scalable solution.
